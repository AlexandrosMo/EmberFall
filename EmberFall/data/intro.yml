"Long ago, before memory could trace its shadow, the gods walked among mortals. But even divinity is not free from discord. Two factions arose, each claiming the fate of humanity as their own. Half of the gods sought to protect mankind, to guide them through the shadows of mortality. 
The other half desired their extinction, deeming them flawed and unworthy of the divine gift of life.

Thus began the Divine Sundering, a celestial war that tore the heavens asunder and shattered the earth itself.
 Mountains collapsed into oceans, forests turned to ash, and cities of stone crumbled to dust. The skies were rent by fire and lightning, echoing with the cries of both gods and men.

Those humans who survived were left with broken minds, haunted by visions of the old world, and cursed to wander a land overrun by horrors. 
Some were driven to madness, writhing in despair; some were condemned to battle the monsters spawned by the gods’ wrath; others were imprisoned, tormented daily in shadowed dungeons.

Amid this ruin, one human awakens. Forgotten, nameless, yet marked by the faintest trace of divine favor. A whisper brushes the mind: a remnant of hope, a promise of salvation. 
The gods’ voices, though fractured and dim, speak of Emberfall—a fragment of the Last Flame, a sacred object that, if returned to the righteous deities, may restore the world to its former glory.
This is the age of ruin, and you, the chosen, must rise from the ashes."
